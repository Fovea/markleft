markleft.js
===========

The simplest markup language ever.

Overview
--------

The main goal of markleft is to be just as natural as writing normal text:
  * links are replaces with HTML a tags
  * line breaks preserved
  * HTML is escaped
  * bullet points detected and replaced with HTML ul/li tags [TODO]

Markleft combine this with a secondary objective, which is to be extensible offering you the chance to add your own extension to the language.

Synthax
-------

    This is a markleft text with a link: http://www.fovea.cc/

    It also features cool \n's and a bunch things:
    - this
    - that
    - and also that.

Markleft will convert this to:

    This is a markleft text with a link: <a href="http://www.fovea.cc/">http://www.fovea.cc/</a><br />
    <br />
    <br />It also features cool \n's and a bunch things:
    <ul>
    <li>this</li>
    <li>that</li>
    <li>and also that.</li>
    </ul>

Usage
-----

Add markleft.js or markleft.min.js to your page.

    // Retrieve the text from whatever source...
    var text = $('input').val();
    
    // Parse it with markleft
    var html = markleft.toHTML(text);

    // Do whatever you like with your html.
    document.body.innerHTML = html;

Writing Plugins
---------------

You can register your own plugins to markleft. Here's the example of a plugin that puts all your text in lowercase.

    markleft.registerPlugin({
        name: 'lowercase',
        transform: function (text) {
            return text.toLowerCase();
        }
    });

Of course you can and should come up with better ideas for plugins!

Later on you can also unregister your plugin:

    markleft.unregisterPlugin('lowercase');

Advanced usage
--------------

###Tokenize

Some plugins require that their output be final, i.e. not transformed by subsequent plugins. In order to achieve this, the transform method can chose to return an array of strings.

The plugin engine will not run on lines starting with a '<'

See for example this italic plugin:

    markleft.registerPlugin({
        name: 'italic',
        transform: function (text) {
            var exp = /_([^_]+)_/g;
            return text.replace(exp, '<i class="italic">$1</i>');
        }
    });

It will replace `'I am _blue_'` with `'I am <i class="italic">blue</i>'`.

Now imagine that another plugin replace `"xxx"` with `<cite>xxx</cite>`, then we will loose `class="italic"` and end up with an invalid HTML.

That's why this plugin should be writen this way:

    markleft.registerPlugin({
        name: 'italic',
        transform: function (text) {
            var exp = /_([^_]+)_/g;
            return markleft.finalReplace(text, exp, '<i class="italic">$1</i>');
        }
    });

Everything from `<i>` to `</i>` will be ignored by the plugin manager, thus will remain identical when output.

###transformHTML

Of course, there is a way to force a plugin to transform HTML as well (in case you know what you're doing). To do so, it has to define and implement the 'transformHTML' method.

Example:

    markleft.registerPlugin({
        name: 'addLinkClass',
        transformHTML: function (html) {
            var exp = /<a /g;
            return html.replace(exp, "<a class='myclass' ");
        }
    });
